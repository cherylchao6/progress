# Myprogress
Have you ever wonder what would keep you persistent when trying to finish a goal? I believe that it's not about the outcome but "Visualising the gradual changes on oneself" matters the most! Myprogress provides a social media platform that aims to help an individual to record their changes during a progress share with friends with privacy!
